# Find-a-malicious-node-in-a-complex-network
BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
The code is about detecting a sybil node in a complex network.
This code finds its application while we have to find a malicious file spreading user in a complex online social network.
The obtained output matrix from this code can be ranked the least ranked node can be sorted to deduce the malicious node.

OBJECTIVE:
Complex stochastic networks are prone to attacks by unwanted entities who try to obtain certain crucial data to make a profit. Hence it is imperative to detect any attacks on such networks in order to safeguard the userâ€™s information. 
The main objective of this project is to detect the attacks by any malicious user on a network (for instance any social network like Facebook, twitter or any other distributed networks).

OBSERVATION:
After computing the efficiency for the B-matrix and the local efficiency of each node in the ego graph, the results are plotted against the node degrees. It is observed that the B-matrix efficiency and Local efficiency are consistent and are linearly dependent on each other. 
From this it can be inferred that by converting a complex network in to B-matrix and then by ranking them with a
weighing function, the malicious nodes and the honest nodes can be differentiated. 

The resultant graphs and plots are included in the "Detecting_malicious_nodes_in_a_network" pdf along with code snippets.
